## Context Engineering Improvements

- [ ] Implementation plan should describe all BDD scenarios outline
- [ ] It should have clear instructions/prompt to keep an structured object mother fixtures
- [ ] Repositories should be implemented with an Adapter class; which is different than the PanacheRepositories that also belong in the infra_driven layer.
- [ ] Implementation plan should have a dedicated section for:
  - [ ] object mother fixtures
  - [ ] open-api documentation (API-first design)
  - [ ] the first part of implementation plan should be the BDD tests, divided in @E2e and @Integration. The unit tests should not be in a dedicated session, but rather be besides the production code classes
